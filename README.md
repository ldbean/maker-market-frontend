# Maker Market
Welcome to Maker Market. A place where you can find the right artist for the job. As an artist, I have always found it hard to connect with people that are interested in my art. I have always wanted to create not only a place for artists to showcase their skills, but also for anyone looking to hire an artist, or sumbit a request for work that artists with the right skills can apply to.
